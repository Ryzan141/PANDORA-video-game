# PANDORA-video-game
This is video game designed from scratch in Unity

# Preview Videos
Note: The following Video was from testing my game on a standard laptop
Note: I designed and programmed the whole game but did not do visuals so the quality of animations, 3d models, and coloring won't be of the best quality.

# Gameplay
Note: enemy's attack function was turned off in order to just look at their tracking and behaviour.
Note: Debugging mode is on so you will see icons appearing and raytracing lines.

Enemies' behaviour and pathfinding:
